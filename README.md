- There are *six* titles with employees eligible to be mentors:
    - Senior Staff
    - Engineer
    - Senior Engineer
    - Staff
    - Assistant Engineer

- The titles with highest number of potential retirees all have eligible mentors available.

- The amount of eligible mentors is only about 1.71% of the number of retiring employees, so there likely won't be enough mentors available.
